# -Q-R-CODE-GENERATOR
We can use this qrcode generator to send sensitive data by creating its file and  into passing it via qr code .We can also send official messages with great security.Thus it can be used in multiple ways in businesses,hotels, e-commerce websites, during online payment etc.


In this project I have created a qr code generator in tkinter using pyqrcode library. This will be a desktop app in which users will be able to generate qr codes and save it as  pdf including a image with extention of .svg(scalable vector graphics) .


In order to get started i needed  to install the following libraries as shown below with the help of pip command
 
•	pip install pyqrcode

•	pip install tkinter
